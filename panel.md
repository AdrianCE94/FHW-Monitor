# Types of Monitor Panels

## TN (Twisted Nematic)
An older technology with fast response times, but limited color reproduction due to its 6-bit capability.

## VA (Vertical Alignment)
Offers precise color reproduction, good viewing angles, and improved contrasts, although it may have response times of up to 12 ms.

## IPS (In-Plane Switching)
Provides exceptional color reproduction, uniform visibility from all angles, and high image quality.
